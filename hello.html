</head>On Costa Rica’s Caribbean coast, just above the Panamanian border, Playa Manzanillo is the prototypical beach with white-sand shores, azure waters, and a backdrop of palm-fringed rainforest courtesy of the Gandoca-Manzanillo Wildlife Refuge. But despite the abundance of coral reefs, which can be explored by kayak or swimming thanks to the area’s gentle waves, its remote location has largely kept it off the tourist radar (don’t be surprised if your only neighbors are manatees and dolphins). If you’re looking for low-key luxury, set up camp at the Tree House Lodge in nearby Punta Uva, where five sustainably built villas are situated around a century-old Sangrillo tree.
